<title>Swimming and Lifeguarding - Bill Sun</title>

<h1>Swimming and Lifeguarding</h1>
<h3>City of Toronto, Earl Haig Secondary School</h3><br>

<p>Between winter 2015 and summer 2016, I worked as a lifeguard, swim instructor, and aquatics program assistant for the city of Toronto. My work involved everything from ensuring pool safety to teaching city swimming programs.</p>

<p>Throughout high school, I was a member of my school's swim team, winning multiple individual and team awards (including two-time city of Toronto champions), and serving as co-captain in the final year.</p>
