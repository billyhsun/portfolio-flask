<h1>Autonomous Pill Packaging Machine</h1>
<h3>AER201 - Engineering Design, University of Toronto</h3>
<h4>Instructor: Prof. M. Reza Emami</h4>

<p>AER201 is an multidisciplinary engineering design course that involves the design and construction of an autonomous robot, in teams of 3. My team had to build an autonomous pill packaging machine, where the user inserts a prescription organizer box and 3 different types of pills, and the machine organizes the pills into the pillbox based on given instructions. The instructions are loaded through a user interface on the machine. The requirements for the machine are outlined in the <a href="files/RFP - Pill Boxing.pdf">Request for Proposal (RFP)</a>.</p>

<p>Based on the requirements from the RFP, my team developed a potential design using the engineering design process, outlined by the <a href="static/files/Team 7 Proposal.pdf">Proposal Document</a>.</p> 

<p>As a part of the role division of team members, I am mainly responsible for the elctromechanical subsystem of the machine. This includes all the structural, mechanical, and some electrical parts of the robot. It comprises the selection and powering of actuators (motors) and material selection. In addition, I am also involved in the circuits construction and programming of the microcontroller that controls all the functionalities.</p>

<p>The <a href="static/files/Final Report.pdf">Final Report</a> describes all the design decisions, construction and integration process, and testing procedures. All the code and datasheets are also on this document. The final product is currently partially functional. </p>
