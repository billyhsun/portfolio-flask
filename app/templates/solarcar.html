<title>Solar Car Team - Bill Sun</title>

<h1>Blue Sky Solar Car Racing Team</h1>
<h3>University of Toronto</h3><br>

<p><a href="http://blueskysolar.utoronto.ca/">Team Page</a></p>

<p>During the summer of 2017, I was a part of the Blue Sky Solar Power Vehicle Team, where a solar powered car named <i>Polaris</i> was designed and built to participate in the <a href="https://www.worldsolarchallenge.org/dashboard/galleries">Bridgestone World Solar Challenge</a>. The team ultimately finished 11th place overall.</p>

<p>I participated in the fabrication of electrical and mechanical parts, including the main cover of the vehicle consisting of the solar panels, and the battery packages. </p>
