<title>DEEP Summer Academy - Bill Sun</title>

<h1>DEEP Summer Academy</h1>
<h3>University of Toronto</h3><br>

<p>During the summer of 2015, I participated in University of Toronto's <a href="http://outreach.engineering.utoronto.ca/pre-university-programs/deep/">Da Vinci Engineering Enrichment Program (DEEP)</a>, a selective engineering summer camp for high school students. It was an eye-opening experience that ultimately led me to pursue engineering as a profession and enroll in University of Toronto's Engineering Science Program.</p>

<p>During the 5 weeks there, I took part in the following programs:</p>
<p>1. Designing and Building a Computer</p>
<p>2. Advanced Manufacturing: 3D printing</p>
<p>3. Magnetic Materials</p>
<p>4. Autonomous Vehicles Design</p>
<p>5. Engineering Leadership and Innovation</p>
